## **Introduction to C++**

C++ is a powerful, high-performance programming language widely used for developing software, games, operating systems, and more. It supports procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming paradigms.

This repository aims to:
- Provide clear explanations of C++ concepts.
- Demonstrate practical examples of C++ code.
- Help beginners get started with C++.

---

## **Setup and Environment**

### Prerequisites:
- Install a C++ compiler, such as:
  - GCC (via MinGW on Windows, or pre-installed on Linux/macOS).
  - Visual Studio (Windows).
  - Clang.
- Use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like:
  - Visual Studio Code (with C++ extension).
  - Code::Blocks.
  - CLion.

### Steps to Run Code:
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cpp-basics.git
   cd cpp-basics
   ```
2. Compile the code using a C++ compiler:
   ```bash
   g++ filename.cpp -o output
   ```
3. Run the compiled program:
   ```bash
   ./output
   ```
