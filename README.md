## **Introduction**

Modern C++ (C++11 and beyond) is a powerful programming language that emphasizes performance, abstraction, and reliability. This repository is designed to help programmers, both beginners and experienced, explore the features and principles that make C++ an essential tool for software development.

---

## **Key Concepts of Modern C++**
- **General-Purpose Programming**: Suitable for a wide variety of applications, from systems programming to game development.
- **Type-Rich Abstractions**: Enables the creation of type-safe, efficient abstractions for better program structure and reliability.
- **Support for Multiple Paradigms**:
  - Procedural programming.
  - Object-oriented programming (OOP).
  - Generic programming using templates.
  - Functional programming.
- **Focus on Resource Management**: Employing RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) principles.
- **Concurrency**: Built-in support for multithreading and concurrent programming.

## **Setup and Environment**

### Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler supporting modern C++ standards:
  - GCC (minimum version: 4.8 for C++11, 7 for C++17).
  - Clang (minimum version: 3.3 for C++11, 6 for C++17).
  - Microsoft Visual Studio (2015 or later).
- Recommended IDEs:
  - Visual Studio Code with the C++ extension.
  - CLion.
  - Code::Blocks.

### Steps to Run Code

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cpp-programming.git
   cd cpp-programming
   ```
2. Compile the code using a C++ compiler:
   ```bash
   g++ filename.cpp -o output
   ```
3. Run the compiled program:
   ```bash
   ./output
   ```
